ImageQR
=======

What would life be like if you could get a digital image without the need of an internet connection? Here it is, it's called ImageQR!


**How does it work?**

What ImageQR basicaly does is the following:
- Get raw image data
- Safely url encode data to provide error-less reading
- Make the qr-code


**Comming soon**

- Android app containing image scanning
- Better encoding/compression
- Support for bigger pictures (currently only small & low-res pictures supported)


**Made in PHP, because we love it!**

(app will be made in Javascript/CSS/HTML for multiplatform support)
